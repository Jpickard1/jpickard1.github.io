## [iReprogram](https://ireprogram.com/)
I am currently the senior software engineer at [iReprogram](https://ireprogram.com/). iReprogram is pioneering new methods in cell reprogramming and regenerative methods based on mathematically tractable and control theoretic algorithms. To ready a series of research based methods to a clinically relevant stage, iReprogram it undergoing a series of automation based projects to increase the throughput and reproducibility of wet lab research. In my capacity as the lead software engineer for iReprogram, I work to design, implement, and execute production quality software based on rigorous theoretical and experimentally validated research.

## [Hypergraphs and Higher Order Structures Project](https://hypergraph-analysis-toolbox.readthedocs.io/)
This project aims to develope methods, algorithms, and frameworks for analizing high dimensional data with complex relationships by extending ideas from graph theory an linear algebra. I have developed and investigated methods for constructing hypergraphs from data and graph structures with particular focus on chromosome architecture and understanding the relationship between Hi-C, PoreC, and gene expression data. Spectral, multi-linear, and statistical methods are deployed to identify multiway relationships among random variables or vertices in a graph or hypergraph structure. The most recent work related to this project is available [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11166), in a short notice that presents the [Hypergraph Analytics Toolbox](https://hypergraph-analysis-toolbox.readthedocs.io/).
