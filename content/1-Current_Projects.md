## Studying Biology
This summer I am working with [Indika Rajapakse](https://rajapakse.lab.medicine.umich.edu/home) and his group to understand the relations between networks, dynamics, and cell biology.

## VRE Transmission Models
Vancomycin Resistant Enterococcus (VRE) is an antibiotic ressitant bacteria commonly found at in patient health settings. Working with the [King](https://kinglab.eeb.lsa.umich.edu/) and [Woods](https://the-woods-lab.com/) Labs, I have been developing models to simulate in patient movement patters at Michigan Medicine. The simulation models are multiorder Markov models based on the paper [Selective Markov Models for Predicting Web-Page Accesses](https://archive.siam.org/meetings/sdm01/pdf/sdm01_04.pdf). These models are built based on a decade of patient data, and they are the basis for simulating coupled disease transmission models using estimated parameters for VRE transmission. The purpose of studying the movement patterns is to provide insight into the hospital population, which is structured in space and patient comorbidities. The simulation algorithm is based off of the [Gillespie Direct Method](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0021999176900413). This work is part of a larger project by the group studying VRE tranmission at Michigan Medicine.
