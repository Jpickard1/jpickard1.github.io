During the summer of 2021, I was an instructor for the [Data Science for Biomedical Scientist](https://midas.umich.edu/data-science-for-biomedical-scientists/) workshop. This one week course covered the fundamentals of data science and introductory machine learning. I developed and taught programming lectures that applied different algorithms to biological and clinical data.

The code and the data are available in google colab notebooks below. Each notebook contains a description of the data used and some instructions for how to run the code. The notebooks run in google colab and used data stored on github, so you can run them on any machine. Ning Ping was an instructor for this course and coauthored these notebooks with me.

### Neural Networks

Note this colab notebook currently relies on additional import files to deal with the data set, so it can't be run from colab. However, the expected output can be seen and the notebook and required files can be found in the git repo.
