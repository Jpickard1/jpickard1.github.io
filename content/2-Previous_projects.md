## Michigan Institute of Data Science Bootcamp

During the summer of 2021, I was an instructor for the [Data Science for Biomedical Scientist](https://midas.umich.edu/data-science-for-biomedical-scientists/) workshop. This one week course covered the fundamentals of data science and introductory machine learning. I developed and taught programming lectures that applied different algorithms to biological and clinical data.
