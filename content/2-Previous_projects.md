## [Michigan Institute of Data Science Bootcamp](https://jpickard1.github.io/content/previous_projects/MIDAS.html)

During the summer of 2021, I was an instructor for the [Data Science for Biomedical Scientist](https://midas.umich.edu/data-science-for-biomedical-scientists/) workshop. This one week course covered the fundamentals of data science and introductory machine learning. I developed and taught programming lectures that applied different algorithms to biological and clinical data. My code and the data used are available in google colab notebooks.

## [Intelligent Fault Detection with Ball Bearings](https://jpickard1.github.io/content/previous_projects/Ball_Bearings_and_Vibration_Images.pdf)

This project explored and recreated the results in the paper [Rolling Element Bearing Fault Diagnosis Using Convolutional Neural Network and Vibration Image](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1389041717303261).

## [Machine Learning Notes](https://www.overleaf.com/read/mtqnnjcbxtsk)

During my time at the University of Michigan, I have been complining a set of notes covering my favorite topics in machine learning, signals processing, and other related topics. This document initially began when I took Signals Processing and Machine Learning for Biomedical Sciences and Introduction to Machine Learning in the winter of 2021, and it has grown to include additional material as well.
