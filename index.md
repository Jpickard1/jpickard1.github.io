I am a student at the University of Michigan in the Department of Computer Science and Electricial Engineering and the Deparment of Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics. I am currently interested in mathematical modeling, signals processing, and machine learning. This website contains information on my current work, previous projects, and interests.

## Reading List
- Just a description of what it is, and a link to the page

## Modeling Spread of Disease
- A description of the project, a link to relevant papers, perhaps some math

## Tensor Project
- A document with pseudo code written up
- Relevant papers
- Some slides describing the work...

## Machine Learning
- A page with my notes from 580
- Links to MIDAS course notebooks, which I should switch to be hosted in colab
## Previous Projects
- This page could just have some stuff about the naive bayes classifier I built
- The work I did on ball bearings
