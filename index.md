I am a student at the University of Michigan in the Deparment of Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics, and I previously completed my undergraduate work also at Michigan in the Department of Computer Science and Electricial Engineering through the college of engineering. I am currently interested in mathematical modeling, signals processing, and machine learning. This website contains information on my current work, previous projects, and interests.

Currently I work in the [Rajapakse Lab](https://rajapakse.lab.medicine.umich.edu/home) under the supervision of Professor Indika Rajapakse. Our work is interested in the mathematics behind higher order structures, dynamical systems, and cell reprogramming.
