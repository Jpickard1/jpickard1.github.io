I am a student at the University of Michigan in the Department of Computer Science and Electricial Engineering and the Deparment of Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics. I am currently interested in mathematical modeling, signals processing, and machine learning. This website contains information on my current work, previous projects, and interests.

Currently I am working on research projects in the [Biomedical and Clinical Informatics Lab](https://najarianlab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/people/joshua-pickard) and a joint project between the King and Woods Labs.
